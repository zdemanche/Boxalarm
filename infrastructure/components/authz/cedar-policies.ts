// Department-scoping is NOT expressed here as a `when` clause comparing
// principal/resource attributes. Two things rule that out for every action above:
//   1. @boxalarm/authz's isAuthorized() calls IsAuthorizedWithTokenCommand with the
//      caller's ACCESS token. Per the Verified Permissions docs, access-token claims
//      map to the request's `context`, never to principal entity attributes — only ID
//      tokens populate principal attributes. custom:deptId (the actual claim name) would
//      need to be read via context, not principal.deptId.
//   2. decide.ts's isAuthorized() passes only { entityType, entityId } for the resource,
//      with no `entities` — so a resource attribute (e.g. resource.deptId) is never
//      populated and any `when` clause referencing it evaluates to an error, which Cedar
//      treats as an implicit DENY. This is a structural fact of how the call is built,
//      not a schema problem this policy store can fix on its own.
// Every action above already targets "my own department's resource" — every
// resourceId(event) call site in the backend passes the caller's own verified deptId
// (or a member scoped to it), so a same-department check would be tautological even if
// it could be expressed. CLAUDE.md states the actual design point plainly: "Export and
// destructive actions are gated by Cedar role check alone." Department isolation is
// enforced where CLAUDE.md says it lives — dept-scoped DynamoDB keys built from the
