#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Creates a department's first ADMIN or CHIEF - the one member nobody else can create,
# because adding members and assigning roles both require an ADMIN or CHIEF already.
#
# It goes through the deployed code, not hand-written items: it invokes the stack's
# members-create Lambda (Cognito login + member row) and then its members-update-roles Lambda
# (Cognito group + member row + audit entry + member.updated event, which also creates the
# member's alerting eligibility snapshot), each with a principal marked "bootstrap" so the
# audit log shows where the member came from. Cognito emails the member a temporary password.
#
# Refuses to run once the department has any ADMIN or CHIEF: after that, use the web app.
# Asks you to re-type the department id (or pass --yes), because a typo would create an
# admin in a department that does not exist. If a run created the login but failed before
# assigning the role, running it again with the same arguments plus --resume finishes the
# job - only for a login that has never signed in, so an existing member is never promoted.
# Don't run it twice at once for the same department.
#
# Usage:
#   bootstrap-first-admin.sh <env> --dept-id NICHOLS --email chief@example.org \
#     --first-name Pat --last-name Doe --phone +12035550100 --rank Chief \
#     --agency-id NICHOLS-FD [--role CHIEF|ADMIN] [--join-date YYYY-MM-DD] [--yes] [--resume]
# Needs the AWS CLI v2 and jq, with credentials for the stack's account. AWS_REGION defaults
# to us-east-1 (every stack is pinned there).
